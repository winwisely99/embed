# Security Layering

## Layers / RINGS

Users can Promote other users into a higher security ring.
The higher the security the harder to get invited in and to use.
For example Ring B could require a Bluetooth based Key Pairing. IE you met in person to pair.

Rings are better than lots of knobs because users screw them up. Telegram and Hong kong is a perfect example.


## Threat Models

- Its generic and can be from:

Properties typically are:

- Social Structure
	- Gas Lighting cyber warfare, etc
	- Social Hacking
	- diminish their ability to operate.
- Information, planning
- IP addresses of Users
- HA ( take down )

Range is:

a. Weakest

- Can be broken into the enemy knows what your going to do.
- You know the users IP.
- Can go down and not end of the world

b. Strongest

- If broken into is life threatening
- If goes down is life threatening

# Onboaridng across level example

Hardest if onboaridng / key exchange

# cipher

One time crypto pad
- used by security services
- provable.
- serversgenerating randomness
- just agree on time ( shared ) and shard key.

NEED Random number generator o fhgh quality
- How to test 
- Noise from a zdiode. ( its a real physic diode )



# Phscial Secuirty 

- faraday box where all parties put all mobiles etc into the box to have a meeting
	- portable


- Mifi, so you separate the User device form the comms device.
	- Adguard DNS Proxy runnng onthe MIFI
	- Tablet is the device with your keys.

- Cryptophone
	- flashes the EPROM even

TheThin listeing device
- Built in 1930's 

# Security training

- best practice procedure.
	- airpot ( phone off )




## Approaches

Vertical Islanda
- 

1. Allowing users to have Rights that is based on security hardening

2. Horizontal islands

- Resiliency
